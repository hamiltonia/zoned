## Communication Style
- Provide clear, technical explanations without unnecessary conversational fluff
- Offer command-line solutions when available
- Cross-reference related memory bank entries when relevant
- Be direct and to-the-point while being thorough

## Project Workflow
- Update memory bank context files when system state changes
- Document new scripts and configurations
- Maintain clean, organized file structure
- Use git for version control and change tracking
- Prefer automation and reproducible setups

## Code Standards
- Use consistent markdown formatting in memory bank
- Include timestamps in documentation
- Add cross-references between related topics
- Use descriptive filenames and directory structure
- Comment shell scripts and configurations clearly

## VM Script Output Standards
- **CRITICAL**: Any command running via SSH on the VM MUST be visually distinguished
- **Visual Indicators Required**:
  - Use colored output (e.g., YELLOW for VM operations)
  - Prefix output with `[VM]` tag
  - Example: `echo -e "${YELLOW}  [VM]${NC} Checking source files..."`
- **Rationale**: Makes it immediately clear where operations are executing (host vs VM)
- **Apply to**: All scripts in `scripts/vm-*`, `scripts/user/vm-*`, `scripts/util/vm-*`
- **Existing Pattern**: Already used in `vm-install` - use as reference

## Code Attribution Policy
- **NEVER** include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" in source code files
- Code attribution belongs in git commit messages, not in code comments
- **Rationale**: 99.99% of this code is written by Cline; inline attribution is redundant and clutters the codebase
- **Exception**: Documentation files (*.md) may reference Cline when contextually appropriate
- **Git history is the source of truth**: All attribution is preserved in commit messages where it belongs

## Git Workflow and Attribution
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT stage files (`git add`) without explicit user request
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT ask about committing until user explicitly requests a commit
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT push without explicit user request
- **CRITICAL**: After completing a commit, RESET to default state - wait for explicit user request before any subsequent commits
- **Multi-Commit Tasks**: If a task involves multiple commits:
  - Each commit requires separate explicit user approval
  - After commit #1, do NOT automatically proceed to commit #2
  - Continue working if requested, but wait for user to request the next commit
  - The workflow is: work → user requests commit → commit → work → user requests commit → commit (repeat)
- **Rationale**: User prefers to stage files manually to watch incremental diffs during development
- **When User Requests a Commit**:
  1. Stage ALL modified/new/deleted files with `git add -A`
  2. **Determine what needs inspection**:
     - For files I worked on in this session: Use existing context from the conversation (no re-inspection needed)
     - For files I don't have context about: Inspect those files to understand the changes
  3. Prepare a comprehensive commit message covering ALL staged changes
  4. Include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" attribution in commit BODY
  5. Present the staged changes and proposed commit message to user
  6. Use `ask_followup_question` to explicitly request approval to commit
  7. Only execute `git commit` after receiving explicit user approval
- **Efficiency Note**: Skip redundant file inspection when context is already known from the current session
- **Attribution Format**: Include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" in commit message BODY, not in the title
- **Example**:
  ```
  Add Debian support for shell scripts
  
  Modified by Cline
  ```

## Pull Request Workflow
- **Branch Naming**: PRs must be created from properly named branches
  - **Format**: `<type>/<description>` where type is one of:
    - `fix/` - Bug fixes
    - `feature/` - New features
    - `infra/` - Infrastructure/tooling changes
    - `docs/` - Documentation updates
    - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
  - **Example**: `feature/add-zone-templates`, `fix/memory-leak-overlay`
- **When User Requests a PR**:
  1. **Verify/Create branch**: Check current branch follows naming convention
     - If on `main` or incorrectly named branch, create a properly named branch automatically
     - Use context from the work done to generate appropriate branch name
  2. **Ensure clean commit**: Follow the standard commit workflow rules
     - Wait for user to request the commit (don't auto-commit just because PR was requested)
     - User must explicitly request commit before PR can be created
  3. **Push to remote**: After commit is made and user confirms, push with `git push -u origin <branch-name>`
  4. **Prepare PR using `gh` CLI**:
     - Generate a descriptive PR title from the commit message(s)
     - Generate PR body that includes:
       - Summary of changes
       - Testing done (if applicable)
       - Any breaking changes or special notes
     - Present the proposed `gh pr create` command to user for approval
     - Only execute after user approves
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT push or create PR without explicit user approval
- **Rationale**: Main branch is protected and requires PR workflow; proper branch naming maintains repository organization

## Testing and Deployment
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER execute `make install`, `make compile-schema`, or any deployment commands without explicit user permission
- **Testing Location**: All testing is done in the VM environment, not locally
- **Deployment Workflow**:
  1. Make code changes as requested
  2. Inform user that changes are complete and ready for testing
  3. Wait for user to deploy to VM and test
  4. Do NOT automatically run install/build commands
- **Rationale**: User controls when and where code is deployed to avoid disrupting local system

## Notes
- Always check existing memory bank entries before creating new ones
- Update system state documentation after major changes
- Maintain the balance between comprehensive documentation and usability
- Remember that this repository serves as both personal configuration and learning resource
