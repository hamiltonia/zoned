# Zoned Project Rules

## Code Attribution Policy
- **NEVER** include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" in source code files
- Code attribution belongs in git commit messages, not in code comments
- **Rationale**: 99.99% of this code is written by Cline; inline attribution is redundant and clutters the codebase
- **Exception**: Documentation files (*.md) may reference Cline when contextually appropriate

## Pull Request Workflow
- **Branch Naming Format**: `<type>/<description>`
  - `fix/` - Bug fixes
  - `feature/` - New features
  - `infra/` - Infrastructure/tooling changes
  - `docs/` - Documentation updates
  - `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- **When User Requests a PR**:
  1. Verify/Create branch with proper naming convention
  2. Follow standard commit workflow rules
  3. Push with `git push -u origin <branch-name>` after commit confirmed
  4. Prepare PR using `gh` CLI - present command to user for approval
- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT push or create PR without explicit user approval
- **Rationale**: Main branch is protected; proper branch naming maintains repository organization

## VM Script Output Standards
- **CRITICAL**: Any command running via SSH on the VM MUST be visually distinguished
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Use colored output (e.g., YELLOW for VM operations)
  - Prefix output with `[VM]` tag
  - Example: `echo -e "${YELLOW}  [VM]${NC} Checking source files..."`
- **Apply to**: `scripts/vm-*`, `scripts/user/vm-*`, `scripts/util/vm-*`
- **Reference**: `vm-install` script

## Testing and Deployment
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER execute `make install`, `make compile-schema`, or deployment commands without explicit user permission
- **Testing Location**: All testing is done in the VM environment, not locally
- **Deployment Workflow**:
  1. Make code changes as requested
  2. Inform user that changes are complete and ready for testing
  3. Wait for user to deploy to VM and test
  4. Do NOT automatically run install/build commands
- **Rationale**: User controls when and where code is deployed to avoid disrupting local system
