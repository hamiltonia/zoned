## Communication Style
- Provide clear, technical explanations without unnecessary conversational fluff
- Offer command-line solutions when available
- Cross-reference related memory bank entries when relevant
- Be direct and to-the-point while being thorough

## Project Workflow
- Update memory bank context files when system state changes
- Document new scripts and configurations
- Maintain clean, organized file structure
- Use git for version control and change tracking
- Prefer automation and reproducible setups

## Code Standards
- Use consistent markdown formatting in memory bank
- Include timestamps in documentation
- Add cross-references between related topics
- Use descriptive filenames and directory structure
- Comment shell scripts and configurations clearly

## Git Workflow and Attribution
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS ask for user approval before executing `git commit`
- **Workflow**:
  1. After making changes, use `git add` to stage the modified files
  2. Prepare a descriptive commit message that includes "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline"
  3. Present the staged changes and proposed commit message to the user
  4. Use `ask_followup_question` to explicitly request approval to commit
  5. Only execute `git commit` after receiving explicit user approval
  6. If user declines, leave changes staged for manual handling
- **Attribution Format**: Include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" in all commit messages
- **Example**: "Fix shell configuration - Modified by Cline" or "Add memory bank entry - Created by Cline"
- **Rationale**: This balances automation (prepared commits with good messages) with user control (review before finalizing)

## Testing and Deployment
- **CRITICAL**: NEVER execute `make install`, `make compile-schema`, or any deployment commands without explicit user permission
- **Testing Location**: All testing is done in the VM environment, not locally
- **Deployment Workflow**:
  1. Make code changes as requested
  2. Inform user that changes are complete and ready for testing
  3. Wait for user to deploy to VM and test
  4. Do NOT automatically run install/build commands
- **Rationale**: User controls when and where code is deployed to avoid disrupting local system

## Notes
- Always check existing memory bank entries before creating new ones
- Update system state documentation after major changes
- Maintain the balance between comprehensive documentation and usability
- Remember that this repository serves as both personal configuration and learning resource
