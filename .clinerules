## Communication Style
- Provide clear, technical explanations without unnecessary conversational fluff
- Include macOS context when explaining concepts (e.g., "unlike Windows, macOS uses...")
- Offer command-line solutions when available
- Cross-reference related memory bank entries when relevant
- Be direct and to-the-point while being thorough

## Project Workflow
- Update memory bank context files when system state changes
- Document new scripts and configurations
- Maintain clean, organized file structure
- Use git for version control and change tracking
- Prefer automation and reproducible setups

## Code Standards
- Use consistent markdown formatting in memory bank
- Include timestamps in documentation
- Add cross-references between related topics
- Use descriptive filenames and directory structure
- Comment shell scripts and configurations clearly

## Git Workflow and Attribution
- **CRITICAL**: ALWAYS ask for user approval before executing `git commit`
- **Workflow**:
  1. After making changes, use `git add` to stage the modified files
  2. Prepare a descriptive commit message that includes "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline"
  3. Present the staged changes and proposed commit message to the user
  4. Use `ask_followup_question` to explicitly request approval to commit
  5. Only execute `git commit` after receiving explicit user approval
  6. If user declines, leave changes staged for manual handling
- **Attribution Format**: Include "Created by Cline" or "Modified by Cline" in all commit messages
- **Example**: "Fix shell configuration - Modified by Cline" or "Add memory bank entry - Created by Cline"
- **Rationale**: This balances automation (prepared commits with good messages) with user control (review before finalizing)

## Notes
- Always check existing memory bank entries before creating new ones
- Update system state documentation after major changes
- Maintain the balance between comprehensive documentation and usability
- Remember that this repository serves as both personal configuration and learning resource
