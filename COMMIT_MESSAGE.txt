Refactor VM test infrastructure for clarity and usability

Reorganized the VM test infrastructure from an ad-hoc collection of scripts
into a clean, purposeful structure with two primary test runners and clear
use cases.

## Changes

### New Test Runners

1. **vm-test-mem** (Memory Leak Testing)
   - Renamed from test-with-restarts.sh
   - Added preset support: standard, quick, deep
   - Added interactive mode with prompts
   - Tests specific operations with GNOME Shell restarts between runs
   - Statistical correlation analysis (R²) to detect systematic leaks
   - Distinguishes measurement noise from actual leaks

2. **vm-test-func** (Functional Regression Testing)
   - Evolved from run-all.sh
   - Added preset support: full, quick, minimal
   - Added interactive mode with prompts
   - Runs all 9 tests sequentially for comprehensive verification
   - Removed long-haul mode (now exclusive to run-all.sh)

3. **test-memory-monitored.sh** (Test Engine)
   - Renamed from test-longhaul-interactive.sh
   - Single memory test with live 30-second monitoring
   - Called by vm-test-mem for each test run
   - Can also be used standalone for ad-hoc testing

### Makefile Updates

- Added `vm-test-mem` and `vm-test-func` targets
- Both support PRESET parameter for non-interactive mode
- Updated help text to clearly display available presets
- Legacy aliases maintained for backward compatibility:
  - vm-stability-test → vm-test-func
  - vm-quick-test → vm-test-func PRESET=quick
  - vm-longhaul → test-memory-monitored.sh (deprecated warning)
  - vm-test-restart → vm-test-mem (deprecated warning)

### Documentation

- Updated scripts/vm-test/README.md with:
  - Test runner overview and use cases
  - Preset documentation for both runners
  - Runner hierarchy diagram
  - Updated file structure

### Deleted Files

- test-with-restarts.sh (replaced by vm-test-mem)
- test-longhaul-interactive.sh (replaced by test-memory-monitored.sh)

## Rationale

The previous structure evolved ad-hoc during memory leak debugging, resulting in:
- Overlapping functionality between test-with-restarts and test-longhaul-interactive
- Confusion about which test to use for which purpose
- No clear automation path (all tests required interactive prompts)

The new structure provides:
- **Clear separation**: vm-test-mem for memory testing, vm-test-func for regression
- **Flexibility**: Interactive mode for investigation, presets for automation
- **Consistency**: Both runners follow the same preset pattern
- **Documentation**: Make help clearly shows available options

## Usage Examples

Functional testing:
  make vm-test-func                # Interactive
  make vm-test-func PRESET=quick   # CI/automation

Memory testing:
  make vm-test-mem                   # Interactive investigation
  make vm-test-mem PRESET=standard   # Standard memory test

Long-haul soak testing:
  make vm-longhaul-all DURATION=8h   # Advanced per-test analysis
